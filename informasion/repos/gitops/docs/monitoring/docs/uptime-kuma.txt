# Uptime-Kuma - http://monitoring.pukara.dev

We often monitor our client's websites/APIs/DNS using [uptime-kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma). Initially, monitoring typically involves HTTP checks, but it can extend beyond that. Alerts are usually sent to our Slack channel ([#alerts](https://pukara.slack.com/archives/C04NQTLA25N)).

## Adding Monitor Targets

This is done manually, as we currently do not have an automated system to register targets in Uptime Kuma.

Steps to add new targets:

  1. Log in to Uptime Kuma (credentials are in 1Password).
  2. Select "Add New Monitor" and enter the details of what you need to monitor.

You could also add a Status Page, but keep in mind that it will be public at https://monitoring.pukara.dev/status/$GroupName.
