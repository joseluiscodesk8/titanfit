# Pukara's Internal Developer Portal

At Pukara, we use Backstage as our internal developer portal. We manage our software catalog, Git repository templates, documentation, and liveness integration with our Kubernetes clusters to observe the real-time health of our services.

## How the IDP Works for Pukara

Backstage is configured to automatically discover all repositories in our organization (*https://github.com/pukara-dev*) and index two things:

1. The `catalog-info.yaml` file in the root directory.
2. All `/templates/**/*template.yaml` files in [Pukara's Backstage repository](https://github.com/pukara-dev/backstage) to index the software templates.

It also indexes all of Pukara's users and groups within GitHub, including their logos üòè.
